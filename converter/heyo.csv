 ","Timothy D. Cook
 CEO & Director
 Thanks, Tejas.","Good afternoon, and thanks to all of you for joining us.
 ","We're thrilled to report Apple's biggest quarter ever, which set new all-time records in both revenue and
 earnings.","We generated revenue of $91.8 billion, which is above the high end of our guidance range, with
 revenue growth accelerating for the third consecutive quarter.","Geographically, we set all-time records in
 the Americas, Europe and rest of Asia Pacific and saw Greater China return to growth.
 
 ","Our record performance was fueled by iPhone, where December quarter revenue was up 8% year-over-
 year and by our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth outside of iPhone including a new all-
 time record for Services and another blowout quarter for Wearables.","Our active installed base of devices
 
 has now surpassed 1.5 billion, up over 100 million in the last 12 months alone, reaching a new all-time
 high for each of our main product categories and geographic segments.","Not only is our large and growing
 installed base a powerful testament to the satisfaction, engagement and loyalty of our customers","but it's
 also fueling our growth across the board, particularly in Services.
 ",Let's take each category one by one.,"On iPhone, revenue in the December quarter was $56 billion.","Again,
 that's up 8% over a year ago, thanks to the exceptional demand for the iPhone 11, iPhone 11","Pro and
 iPhone 11 Pro Max.","In fact, iPhone 11 was our top-selling model every week during the December quarter,
 and the 3 new models were our 3 most popular iPhones.","We had double-digit growth in many developed
 markets, including the U.S., the U.K., France and Singapore and also grew double digits in emerging
 markets, led by strong performances in Brazil, Mainland China, India, Thailand and Turkey.","These new
 models are, by far, the best iPhones we've ever shipped with advanced technologies, an unprecedented
 leap in battery life to easily get through the day and a best-in-class camera experience.","We have been
 wowed with the photos customers have shared in our all-new Night mode photo challenge this month.
 ",Turning to Services.,"Q1 revenue reached $12.7 billion, an all-time record, growing 17% over last year.
 ","Once again, we saw double-digit growth in all 5 of our geographic segments and established new all-time
 records for multiple categories including cloud services, music, payment services and our App Store search

 ad business as well as setting a December quarter record for the App Store and AppleCare.","2019 was a
 historic year for our Services business, and I'd like to touch on some highlights.
 ","For the App Store, 2020 started off strong with customer spending a new single-day record $386 million
 on New Year's Day alone, a 20% increase over last year.","Apple Arcade, our new game subscription service,
 has been fast off the blocks with a catalog of over 100 new and exclusive games you won't find anywhere
 else, all playable across Apple devices with new games and expansions added every month.
 ","Apple TV+ is off to a rousing start, and I want to congratulate the entire team at The Morning Show for
 their multiple Golden Globe nominations: Jennifer Aniston on her Screen Actors Guild award; and Billy
 Crudup on his Critics' Choice Award.","We continue to focus on telling stories that matter like Little America,
 which recently premiered to widespread critical acclaim with much more great content still to come.
 ","Apple News now draws over 100 million monthly active users in the U.S., U.K., Australia and Canada and
 provides a curated and personalized experience using on-device intelligence to recommend stories.","Apple
 News+ continues to add new titles, offering subscribers seamless access to the world's top publications
 across all of their devices.
 ","For Apple Pay, revenue and transactions","more than doubled year-over-year with a run rate exceeding
 15 billion transactions a year.","Apple Pay transit support expanded with customers paying for journeys
 on Transport for London more easily with Apple Pay Express Transit.","And in spring of 2020, iPhone and
 Apple Watch customers will be able to simply tap to ride trains and buses in even more cities, including
 Shenzhen and Guangzhou.
 ","We are thrilled with the continued growth of Apple Card, and last month, customers began using Apple
 Card monthly installments at Apple retail and online to purchase new iPhones and pay for them over 24
 months.","We see great promise for these recently launched services, and we're optimistic about what we've
 got in the pipeline for each of them.
 ",Now turning to Wearables.,"We had another incredible quarter, setting an all-time record in virtually every
 market we track around the world, and this product category is now the size of a Fortune 150 company.
 ","Demand for AirPods continues to be phenomenal, particularly for our recently launched AirPods Pro, our
 new addition to the AirPods family that features active noise cancellation.
 ","Apple Watch had a great start to fiscal 2020, setting an all-time revenue record during the quarter.","It
 continues to have a profound impact on our customers' lives, and it continues to further its reach as over
 75% of the customers purchasing Apple Watch during the quarter were new to Apple Watch.","Both AirPods
 and Apple Watch were must-have holiday gifts, helping drive unprecedented results for the category even
 as we face supply constraints for Apple Watch Series 3 and","AirPods Pro.
 ","Mac and iPad generated $7.2 billion and $6 billion in revenue, respectively, and the high level of customer
 satisfaction and loyalty for both products drove the active installed base of both Mac and iPad to new
 records in all geographic segments.","For iPad, we saw growth in key emerging markets like Mexico, India,
 Turkey, Poland, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam.","With our current lineup of iPad Pro, iPad
 Air, iPad mini and iPad, along with the new iPadOS, we give customers an unparalleled tablet experience
 integrating hardware, software and services in a way that only Apple can.
 ","This was also a very exciting quarter for the Mac as we launched our most powerful notebook ever, the 16-
 inch MacBook Pro as well as Mac Pro and Pro Display XDR, the most powerful tools Apple has ever put in
 the hands of pros.","And we've already seen a strong response from the pro community from developers,
 photographers and music producers to filmmakers and scientists who rely on the Mac to create their life's
 best work.
 ","We also want to take a moment to congratulate all the Grammy-winning and nominated artists this past
 weekend, who rely on Logic Pro X and their Mac to create incredible music we all love.","I want to call out
 and celebrate the exceptional work of our retail and online teams.","This quarter, we opened a beautiful
 new store in Kawasaki, Japan, and exciting things are taking place inside each and every store.","Thanks in
 part to a doubling in iPhone trade-ins versus last year, our retail and online stores set an all-time record

 and delivered strong double-digit growth in iPhone.","We see a very bright future for these efforts, and we
 continue to innovate to ensure that everyone who visits an Apple retail location has a great experience.
 ","We began 2020 with our greatest product lineup ever, and we are only deepening our commitment
 to do our part to make the world a better place.","In November, we released a completely redesigned
 Everyone Can Code curriculum to help introduce more elementary and middle school students to the
 world of coding.","The new curriculum includes even more resources for teachers, a brand-new guide for
 students and updated Swift Coding Club materials.","Today, millions of students in more than 5,000 schools
 worldwide use Everyone Can Code curriculum to bring their ideas to life and develop important skills,
 including creativity, collaboration and problem-solving.
 ","November also saw the launch of our new Research app, the latest in our ongoing effort to put the future
 of health in the hands of every user.","Customers in the U.S. can enroll in 3 landmark multiyear health
 studies that we're undertaking with leading academic and research institutions: the Apple Women's Health
 Study, the Apple Heart and Movement Study and the Apple Hearing Study.","As in everything we do, we
 built user privacy into the Research app from the ground up.
 ","This quarter, we also announced a $2.5 billion plan to help address the housing availability and affording
 crisis in our home state of California.","We feel a great responsibility to help the region we have always
 called home stay vibrant and to ensure that it remains a great place for everyone to live and raise a
 family, including those who do so much to serve the community like firefighters and teachers.
 ","In much more recent news, we're closely following the development of the coronavirus.","We're donating to
 groups that are working to contain the outbreak.","We are working closely with our Apple team members
 and partners in the affected areas, and our thoughts are with all of those affected across the region.
 ","As we close the books on a record-breaking December quarter, we are already well underway on some
 new and exciting developments for the future.","Apple's strength will always be its balanced creativity and
 innovation, and this year will be no different.
 ","But for now, for more details on the results, I'd like to turn the call over to Luca.
 ","Luca Maestri
 CFO & Senior VP
 Thank you, Tim.","Good afternoon, everyone.
 ","Our business and financial performance in the December quarter were exceptional as we set new all-time
 records for revenue, net income and earnings per share.","Revenue for the quarter was $91.8 billion, up
 $7.5 billion or 9% from a year ago in spite of a $1 billion headwind from foreign exchange.
 ","Geographically, we established all-time revenue records in many major developed and emerging markets,
 including, among others, the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Brazil, the U.K., Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Poland,
 Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam.","Products revenue was $79.1 billion, up 8% as iPhone returned to growth,
 and we had incredibly strong results in Wearables, where we set all-time records for both Apple Watch and
 AirPods.
 ","Services revenue grew 17% to a new all-time record $12.7 billion with double-digit growth in every
 geographic segment and new all-time records across our portfolio.","Company gross margin was 38.4%, up
 40 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage from higher revenue in spite of a negative 60 basis point
 impact from foreign exchange.","Products gross margin was 34.2%, up 260 basis points sequentially, thanks
 to leverage and favorable mix.","Services gross margin was 64.4%, up 30 basis points sequentially, driven
 by favorable mix.
 ",Our reported tax rate for the quarter was 14.2%.,"Before discrete items, the rate was 16.5%, exactly in
 line with our guidance.",A favorable onetime item impacted the rate by 230 basis points.,"Net income was
 an all-time record at $22.2 billion, up $2.3 billion or 11% over last year.","Diluted EPS was also an all-time
 record at $4.99, up 19%, and operating cash flow was a very strong $30.5 billion, an improvement of $3.8
 billion over a year ago.

 ",Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories.,"iPhone revenue of $56 billion grew 8%
 year-over-year as we saw great customer response to the launch of our newest iPhones.","We set all-time
 revenue records in several countries, including the U.S., Mexico, the U.K., France, Spain, Poland, Thailand,
 Malaysia and Vietnam.","Our active installed base of iPhones has reached an all-time high and is growing in
 each of our geographic segments.","In the U.S., the latest survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates
 iPhone customer satisfaction of 98% for iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max combined.","Among business
 buyers planning to purchase smartphones in the next quarter, 84% plan to purchase iPhones.
 ",Turning to Services.,"We set an all-time revenue record of $12.7 billion with double-digit growth in all of
 our 5 geographic segments.","As Tim mentioned, we established new all-time records for Apple Music, cloud
 services, payment services and our App Store search ad business and December quarter records for the
 App Store and AppleCare.","We are well on our way to accomplishing our goal of doubling our fiscal year
 '16 services revenue during 2020.","We've actually already reached that goal on a run rate basis with the
 results of the December quarter.
 ","Customer engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow, and the number of both transacting and paid
 accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high, with paid accounts growing double
 digits in all of our geographic segments.","We now have over 480 million paid subscriptions across the
 services on our platform, up 120 million from a year ago.","And at this point, we expect to hit our goal of
 surpassing the 500 million mark already during the March quarter.","Given the tremendous momentum we
 are experiencing across our Services offerings, we are increasing our target for paid subscriptions and aim
 to reach 600 million before the end of calendar 2020.
 ","App Store revenue grew strong double digits, thanks to robust customer demand for both in-app
 purchases and subscriptions.","Our third-party subscription business grew across multiple categories and
 increased almost 40% year-over-year.","Our first-party subscription services also continued to perform
 extremely well.","Apple Music set an all-time revenue record, offering a catalog of over 60 million songs to
 our customers.","iCloud also generated an all-time revenue record, growing very strong double digits while
 offering our customers a safe, secure and seamless experience across all their devices.
 ","It was a December quarter record for AppleCare, thanks to strong service agreement attach rates and
 expanded distribution.","Many of our partners have come to appreciate the strength of the AppleCare brand
 and our ability to deliver the very best service and support in the world.","That value resonates with both
 our partners and our customers, and we're very happy to see that quality of experience delivered to more
 and more of our users.
 ","Next, I'd like to talk about Mac and iPad.","Mac revenue was $7.2 billion and iPad revenue was $6 billion.
 ","Both products had a difficult year-over-year comparison due to the launches of MacBook Air, Mac mini
 and iPad Pro during the December quarter a year ago and the subsequent channel fill.","Despite the tough
 compare, on a demand basis, our performance for both Mac and iPad was around even to last year.
 ","Importantly, around half of the customers purchasing Macs and iPads around the world during the quarter
 were new to that product, and the active installed base for both Mac and iPad reached a new all-time high.
 ","The most recent surveys from 451 Research measured a 93% customer satisfaction rating for iPad from
 consumers and 92% from businesses.","And among both consumers and businesses who are planning to
 purchase tablets in the March quarter, 78% plan to purchase iPads.
 ","Wearables, Home and Accessories established a new all-time record with revenue of $10 billion, up 37%
 year-over-year, with very strong double-digit performance across all 5 geographic segments and growth
 across Wearables, Accessories and Home.",We set all-time records for Wearables in virtually every,"market
 ","we track even as we experienced some product shortages due to very strong customer demand for both
 Apple Watch and AirPods during the quarter.
 ","We also continue to see strong demand for our products in the enterprise market as our technology
 solutions enable businesses to do their best work.","100% of Fortune 500 companies in the health care
 sector use Apple technology in areas such as patient experience, clinical communications and nursing
 workflows.","And we're also seeing smaller companies in this sector drive innovation with our technology
 and apps.

 ","One example is Gauss Surgical, which uses Core ML in iOS to more accurately estimate blood loss during
 childbirth and surgery.","This helps clinicians have more complete and timely information on whether a
 patient needs an intervention, which can impact both clinical outcomes and costs.
 ","Another example is Butterfly Network, a medical imaging company which makes a handheld ultrasound
 device that connects to iPhone or iPad to enable clinicians to take an ultrasound anywhere at a cost that is
 dramatically lower than other solutions on the market today.
 ",Let me now turn to our cash positions.,"We ended the quarter with $207 billion in cash plus marketable
 securities.","We issued a 2 billion euro-denominated green bond, retired $1 billion of maturing debt and
 reduced commercial paper by $1 billion during the quarter, leaving us with total debt of $108 billion.","As
 a result, net cash was $99 billion at the end of the quarter, and we maintain our target of reaching a net
 cash neutral position over time.
 ",We returned nearly $25 billion to shareholders during the December quarter.,"We began a $10 billion
 accelerated share repurchase program in November, resulting in initial delivery and retirement of
 30.4 million shares.","We also repurchased 40 million Apple shares for $10 billion through open market
 transactions, and we paid $3.5 billion in dividends and equivalents.","As we have done for the last several
 years, we will share our plans for the next phase of our capital return program when we report results for
 the March quarter.
 ","Finally, as we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types
 of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call.","We expect revenue to be
 between $63 billion and $67 billion.","The wider-than-usual revenue range comprehends uncertainty related
 to the recently unfolding public health situation in China.","We expect gross margin to be between 38%
 and 39%.",We expect OpEx to be between $9.6 billion and $9.7 billion.,"We expect OI&E to be about $250
 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 16.5%.
 ","Also today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.77 per share of common stock
 payable on February 13, 2020, to shareholders of record as of February 10, 2020.
 ","With that, let's open the call to questions.
